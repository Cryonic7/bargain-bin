# The Bargain Bin Bonanza
A repo filled with tools and miscellaneous code that's small enough that it didn't need it's own repo. Separated by folders for each project.

The Unlicense, as specified and expanded by the LICENSE file, applies to all files within this repository, except where expressly and explicitly stated otherwise. If after a thorough search you still have questions or confusion relating to software here and which license applies to it, feel free to contact me through my Github account. I will be more than happy to check and telly ou which license applies to whatever software you'd like to use. Thanks.
